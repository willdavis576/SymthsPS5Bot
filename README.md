This project allows you to constantly poll the Smyths Site to check if the 'Add to Basket' button is available. 
If it isn't, reload the page. If it is, click 'Add to Basket' and alert via email to make you aware.

For PS5 Digital Only. Feel free to mess with it.

Be sure to fill out the MY_ADDRESS and PASSWORD if you want it emailing.
